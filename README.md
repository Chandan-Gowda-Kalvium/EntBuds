CineBuds is a movie review web app that serves two kinds of people, first are the ones who watch films just for killing time and they want to know if they should watch a particular film or not, or should they watch it with family or friends, and many similar questions like that, this is a place where they can know answers to those questions. The second type of audience that this web app serves are the ones who are not just casual viewers of films, they are something like geeks of a film, or a cinematic universe, or something similar like that, they want to talk to different people about films, but they hardly find a place to do so, so this is the platform for them.
